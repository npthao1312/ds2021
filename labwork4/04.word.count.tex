\section{Why you chose your specific MapReduce implementation?}
We choose to implement by Python because it supports dictionary datatype which is extremely convenient in implementing the Map Reduce. By keeping each word and its occurrence by a key:values pair, we can track which word was counted and combined the occurrence list obtained from Mapper in the Reducer easily.

\section{How your Mapper and Reducer work?}

\subsection{Mapper}
After received the input texts, we run the \verb|strip()| function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace. We also remove the punctuation by doing some \verb|sub("[^\w\s]", "", stc)| method. After that, we split the sentences into words.
\begin{lstlisting}
def mapper(file_name):
	f = open(file_name, "r")
	occurence = []

	for line in f:
		sentences = line.split(".")
		for stc in sentences:
			# Remove leading and trailing whitespace
			stc = stc.strip()

			# Remove punctuation
			stc = re.sub("[^\w\s]", "", stc)

			# Split the line into words
			words = stc.split()

			for word in words:
				#print("%s\t%s" % (word, 1))
				occurence.append([word, 1])

	return occurence
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Reducer}
After get the words which are the results of the mapper process, we count the number of each words.
\begin{lstlisting}
def reducer(occurence):
	combined_occ = {}
	for i in range(len(occurence)):
		word = occurence[i][0]
		if word not in combined_occ.keys():
			combined_occ.update({word: 1})
		else:
			occ = combined_occ[word]
			combined_occ.update({word: occ+1})
	return combined_occ
\end{lstlisting}
